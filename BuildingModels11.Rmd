Create an R markdown document that applies your function, for 3 warming scenarios (+1, +2, +3) and 2 Precipitation change scenarios. In the first precipitation scenario January precipitation doubles and in the second scenario, January precipitation is 1/2 of what it currently is. Apply climate changes to all years.  Also run your model for two differnt prices - a high value and a low value
